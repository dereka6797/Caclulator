# Getting Started with creating a calculator in React.js

One of the first things to start doing is ridding of a few unecessary files within the React App folder. 

Inside the code editor I then began by adding a Components folder, which holds all other .js files aside from your initial App.js file. 

Everything from there will be found within the files provided to you, please take as you will and change it to your hearts desire. 

Enjoy!
