# Getting Started with creating a calculator in React.js

One of the first things to start doing is ridding of a few unecessary files within the React App folder. 

Everything from there will be found within the src files, this project is insanely easy and basic, though provides some of the best results out there. Please take as you will and change it to your hearts desire. 

Enjoy!
